rjdverse is an organization dedicated to creating **R packages giving access to JDemetra+** algorithms. 

[JDemetra+](https://github.com/jdemetra) is a versatile time series analysis software, whose core routines are written in Java and also accessible via a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

[[Documentation]](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/) | [[Blog]](https://jdemetra-universe-blog.netlify.app/)

Installation procedure and basic examples are given in the readme file of each package. Their documentation is available via GitHub pages.

Running rjd3 packages requires **Java 17 or higher**. How to set up such a configuration in R is explained [here](https://jdemetra-new-documentation.netlify.app/#Rconfig) 

Below is the list of R packages available from this page (relying on JDemetra+ core Java libraries) and links to add-on packages:
